  <p>Sony has unveiled its latest and greatest gaming console, the PlayStation 5 Pro. This upgraded version of the 2020 PlayStation 5 is designed to deliver stunning visuals<br>
Just like the PS4 Pro before it, the PS5 Pro focuses on enhancing game graphics. It boasts three major upgrades to achieve this</p>

<p>First, the PS5 Pro has a more powerful graphics processor. Although it uses the same basic design, it now has 67% more processing units and 28% faster memory. Sony says this translates to games rendering 45% faster than on the regular PS5.</p><hr>

<p>Another improvement is in ray tracing, a technology that makes in-game lighting look more realistic. The PS5 Pro’s graphics processor has more units for ray tracing, so it can create these effects much faster. Sony says it can do this twice or even three times as quickly as the regular PS5.<br><br>
Finally, Sony announced a new way to make images look sharper. Called PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, it uses AI to improve image quality. This is likely done in hardware, so it should be better than the software-based AMD FSR used on the PS5. It might be as good as Nvidia’s DLSS or Intel’s XeSS. However, Sony didn’t mention any technology to add more frames, so it seems to only improve image sharpness.</p>

<p>PlayStation architect Mark Cerny said that PS5 games needed a choice between higher frames or better graphics. Most players chose faster gameplay, even though it meant poorer graphics. The PS5 Pro aims to solve this problem. It wants to offer high-quality graphics at 60 frames per second</p><hr>

<p>With its more powerful hardware and image-enhancing technology, this seems possible. But we’ll have to see if games support it to know for sure.
<br>
Sony showed off a few games that look better on the new console. These games will have a “PS5 Pro Enhanced” label. Sony also announced a feature called PS5 Pro Game Boost. This can make more than 8,500 PS4 games look better and run faster on the PS5 Pro.</p>

<p>The PS5 Pro looks a bit different from the regular PS5. It’s taller but the same width as the PS5 without a disc drive. You can’t buy a PS5 Pro with a disc drive. You have to buy it separately, just like for the PS5. The good news is that the PS5 Pro has 2 TB of storage, instead of 1 TB on the regular PS5.<br><br>
The PS5 Pro costs $700, 56% more than the $450 digital PS5. You can pre-order it starting September 26th and it goes on sale November 7th.</p><hr>
