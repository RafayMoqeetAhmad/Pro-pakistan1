   <p>Ahead of their Champions League clash with Atletico Madrid, fans from Paris Saint-Germain’s (PSG) Boulogne Kop made a powerful statement, unveiling a massive “Free Palestine” banner at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday.<br>

<p>One of the messages read, “War on the pitch, but peace in the world.” The display also included an image of Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Lebanese flag, highlighting escalating tensions as Israel launched new strikes on Lebanon, resulting in at least 40 casualties in eastern Lebanon.<br>
PSG the club, however, issued a statement saying they were not informed about the plans to display the “Free Palestine”.<br>
Paris Saint-Germain recalls that the Parc des Princes is and must remain a place of communion around a common passion for soccer and firmly opposes any message of a political nature in its stadium,” the club emphasized.<br>
This is not the first instance of fan activism in European football or from across the globe. Last year, Celtic received a €17,500 fine after fans waved Palestinian flags during a Champions League fixture</p><hr>
