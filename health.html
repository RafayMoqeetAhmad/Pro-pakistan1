    <p>A 42-year-old Pakistani pilgrim survived after suffering five heart attacks during Hajj this year, thanks to swift and intensive medical care.<br>
    Amid extreme heat, several pilgrims faced health complications, with some tragically passing away. Among those affected was a Pakistani man who suffered multiple cardiac arrests while performing Hajj.<br>
According to APP, he was rushed to East Arafat Hospital in critical condition. The medical team managed to stabilize him, but due to the severity of his condition, he had to remain on a ventilator.</p>
