    <p>Pakistan cricket stalwarts Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan, and Shaheen Afridi are set to make their Big Bash League (BBL) debut in the upcoming season 15, and former Australia captain and BBL stalwart Aaron Finch cannot wait to see the trio in action.</p><hr>

    <p>Finch, who captained Melbourne Renegades for over a decade before stepping down, believes the addition of such high-calibre international stars will elevate the tournament’s quality and global appeal. He also took the time to praise each individual separately, starting with Shaheen, who was the number 1 pick in this year’s BBL 15 overseas draft.<br><br>
“Wonderful bowler. Now that he’s got so much experience worldwide. If you look at his PSL record, he just keeps winning titles as a captain as well. That shows his leadership not just with the ball but he is well-rounded, so great to have him.”<br><br>
The former Australian captain then went on to give Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan their due.<br><br>
“Babar, one of the best players. Probably the most beautiful batsman you will ever see. He never seems to over-hit the ball, and the pocket rocket, Mohammad Rizwan, he’s dynamic at the top of the order. For the Australian public to witness firsthand and for the domestic players to see how they match up against the best in the world will be awesome to see.”<br><br><hr></p>

<p>BBL 15 will be the first time this trio graces Australia’s premier domestic T20 competition after finally getting time off from international duty during the BBL window. Their value in T20 cricket is represented by the fact that Rizwan and Shaheen did not slip past the 4th pick in the BBL draft, while Babar was already signed by Sydney Sixers beforehand.<br><br>
With the BBL looking to recapture its early momentum, the inclusion of these Pakistani stars could be exactly what the tournament needs—and Finch agrees.<br><br>
As the build-up to BBL 15 gathers pace, fans across Australia and Pakistan will be eagerly waiting to see these stars in action.<br><br>
